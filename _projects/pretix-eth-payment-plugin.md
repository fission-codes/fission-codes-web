We are supporting the EthMagicians Council of Paris 2019 organizing team with ticketing, finance, and other operational tasks. It was decided to more directly integrate support / donations from participants into the registration system. @ligi suggested using [Pretix](https://pretix.eu), an open source ticketing system that has both hosted and self-installed options.

For the Council of Paris, the hosted version was used, but it's clear that an event ticketing system with native ETH payments would be valuable.
