Boris ran a bounty to have the RUN EVM graphic designed, and emailed it off to [Virgil from the Ethereum Foundation](https://twitter.com/virgilgr/status/1083160278987026434). A week later, the [Ethereum Swag store now sells RUN EVM t-shirts](https://swag.ethereum.org/products/run-evm-t-shirt).

This also lead to a write up of [feedback for the Bounties Network team](https://md.spade.builders/uvRwwo3DQ9yrUlWAX7OQJw).

* Accepted and paid out two submissions
* Sent designs to Virgil  & the swag team
* Wrote up UX & feature feedback to Bounties Network team
* Promoted the RUN EVM t-shirt and the Ethereum Swag store
